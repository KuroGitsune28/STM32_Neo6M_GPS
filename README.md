# NEO-6M GPS (STM32 + IOT)

## Overview

This project demonstrates the usage of an accelerometer (e.g., ADXL345) with a STM32 microcontroller. The accelerometer readings are obtained and processed to determine the device's acceleration in three dimensions (X, Y, Z).

## Features

- Read acceleration values from the accelerometer.
- Process and interpret the accelerometer data.
- Interface the accelerometer with a STM32 microcontroller.

## Hardware Requirements

- STM32 microcontroller (e.g., STM32F407G)
- Accelerometer sensor (e.g., ADXL345)
- Required connecting wires

## Software Requirements

- STM32CubeIDE or other STM32 development environment
- Appropriate drivers for the accelerometer

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KuroGitsune28/STM32_ADXL-345.git

## Usage
1. Open the project in your STM32 development environment.
2. Connect the accelerometer to the STM32 microcontroller.
3. Build and flash the project to your STM32 board.
